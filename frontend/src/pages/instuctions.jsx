            Inter IIT Tech Meet comprises of ardent competitions, exhibitions, illuminating talks and exhilarating pro-nights that inspire, enthrall and mesmerize the massive hordes that attend. According to the pan-IIT Tech Board, “The Inter IIT Tech Meet is a consequence of students of various IITs coming together envisioning a progressive India. We realise that there are countless problems which our country faces due to its population, geographic expanse, climate, infrastructure etc. A lot of efforts are being put by various educational institutes for coming up with technology solutions which could address these issues. Numerous government policies and initiatives have created opportunities for promoting and encouraging the development of technology to address the issues. We feel that that IITs being premier education and research institutes must spearhead these initiatives. Enhanced collaboration between IITs would foster development of technology solutions and also encourage more and more graduating students to pursue this into full time ventures wherein they take this technology from research labs to end users, impacting a million lives.”
